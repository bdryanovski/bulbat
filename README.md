# Bulbat

The name is from [random](https://pokemon.alexonsager.net/1/42) generated PokÃ©mon, between Bulbasaur and Golbat.

This is in-memory quick storage that could be synced to the disk if neaded inside an encrypted file.

**WARNING**

**The current implementation is pretty basic in terms of encryption. So don't put any sensitive data**

### Usage

Install the package with
```bash
npm install --save bulbat
```
Import and use
```typescript
import { Database } from 'bulbat';

const db = new Database();

const post = {
  id: 42,
  title: 'Welcome to my blog!',
  content: '...'
};

db.collection('posts').insert(post);

db.collection('posts').data.map((post) => {
  console.log(post);
});
```

You could use the Collection only without the need of the
`Database` instance:

```typescript
import { Collection } from 'bulbat'

const posts = new Collection('posts');

posts.insert(/* data */);

posts.data.map((post) => {
  console.log(post)
});
```

The collection provide an `reduce` method that could be used to sort or change the content of the collection,
internal state. Right now the only way to make bulk actions to the storage.

```typescript
import { Collection } from 'bulbat';

const col = new Collection('posts');

// insert some data into the collection

col.reduce((result, post) => {
  if (post.status !== 'deleted') {
    result.push(post);
  }
  return result;
});

col.data
// => only posts that are not `deleted`
```

Collection require to have `name` as first argument - **this is the minimum requirment**. `CollectionProps`
could be passed to all collections when using the `Database` and overwrite/extend for each collections from
the `Collection` constructor or as second argument to `Database#add` method.

```typescript
const db = Database({ path: `./db` });
db.add('posts', { path: './posts' });
```

Encryption, every collection by default will try to store it's state to the disk inside a encrypted file.The file
is locked with default password of '\<empty-string\>'. You could change this by passing password to all collections
or per collection - you will need to set `CollectionProps.password`. Created collection could not change there password (for now).

```typescript
const db = Database({ password: 'not-qwerty' });
db.add('posts', { password: 'qwerty' }); // will use 'qwerty' for password
db.add('images'); // will use 'not-qwerty' as password
```
